f|no there isn't|reply_n
g|okay well|acknowledge
f|there's a there's a bit a couple of bits down called fields|explain
g|yeah that's we're above there we're halfway|explain

g|mm|acknowledge
f|bit|instruct
g|oke-- okay so another like very very slight slope to the left 'til you're about like a half uh a quarter of an inch away from the paper|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|and then you drop down about an inch and a half|instruct
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|then you go to the right about an inch|instruct
g|and a little bloop up|instruct
f|what|query_w
f|right|acknowledge
g|then you just go bloop and like about tiny tiny bit up and draw an "x" and we're done it should be right to the left of the chestnut tree|instruct
f|oh|acknowledge
g|you're making me pick my nose|explain
f|well we we might be in di-- the chestnut trees might be in different position|explain
f|is it a bloop like a kind of round bit|check

f|where do and i'm just above the spaceship right|align
g|okay so|reply_y
f|so where do you want do you want me to bloop round this round what i've got|query_yn
g|is the eh is the spaceship right to the left of the tree|query_yn
f|no|reply_n
f|it's just above the tree|reply_w
g|oh no you should be y--|reply_n
f|it's above it's well my tree might be different than your tree|explain
g|okay|acknowledge
g|well just just|ready
g|go to the right about an inch and then draw an "x" and we'll be done|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|i got to see your map|explain
