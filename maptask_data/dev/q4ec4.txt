g|right eh from start position you move down past the camera shop to the bottom left corner|instruct
f|right right|acknowledge
f|the camera shop's ri-- directly below the start position right|check
g|yes|reply_y
g|you move down to l-- past the left-hand side of the camera shop|instruct
f|no right|acknowledge
g|and have you got parked van marked there beneath the camera shop|query_yn
f|no|reply_n
f|no-- it's just allotments to the eh right|explain
g|no|acknowledge
f|and slightly below|clarify
g|you move|instruct
g|well approximately three inches below the camera shop you make an arc and then move up up and around the left-hand side of the allotments|instruct
f|and where do i stop|query_w
g|stop just at the bot-- the top right corner of the allotments just above that little shed|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
f|right|ready
g|then you move in an angle slo-- sloping slightly upwards to approximately a third of the way across the page from the right and stop|instruct
f|so what is this eh there's a flight museum here on the|query_w
g|it's not marked on my map|reply_w
f|oh right|acknowledge
f|ehm it's eh on the same level as the start position basically|explain
g|slightly below approximately on level with the top of the camera shop|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
f|so you make an angle and that's a straight line|check
g|a straight line yes|reply_y
f|right|acknowledge
f|from there to just above the camera shop|check
g|yeah|reply_y
g|approximately two thirds away t-- from the right-hand side of the page|clarify
f|uh from the right-hand side of the page|check
g|no sorry|reply_n
g|one third away from the right-hand side of the page|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
f|that's just below the flight museum|explain
f|okay|align
g|well pu--|instruct
g|have you got yacht club marked bottom right corner|query_yn
f|yes uh-huh|reply_y
g|well it's just slightly to the left of the yacht club on a level with the camera shop roof|clarify
f|okay|acknowledge
f|and where do we go after that|query_w
g|you turn straight up the page and make a straight line which curves over and around top of the disused monastery|reply_w
g|have you got that mark|query_yn
f|what on top of the monastery|check
g|above the monastery|clarify
f|and t-- uh right okay that's okay|acknowledge
g|to the left up the to the right and then curves over to the left|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
f|so we're going from like above the allotments to just above the yacht club no just above but ehm about|check
g|approximately three inches|clarify
f|same level as the camera shop basically|check
g|three four inches|clarify
g|yeah|reply_y
f|and then eh from there going to disused monastery|check
g|yes|reply_y
f|right|acknowledge
g|curving around the top of the disused monastery|clarify
f|yeah right|acknowledge
f|right|ready
f|so curve around the disused monastery then where|query_w
g|and stop on the level with the base of it then the curve reverses itself and goes approximately li-- like it was before and then goes vertically up the side of the gr-- the alpine garden|reply_w
f|right|acknowledge
f|could you just say that again|query_w
g|right from the disused monastery the left-hand side of disused monastery the curve makes a dip rather than a rise a trough|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
g|and stops level with the left-hand side of the alpine garden|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
f|so it's a a curve eh pointing upwards to get to the disused monastery|check
g|no|reply_n
g|a curve poin-- going down the way uh|clarify
f|that's what i mean|explain
f|i mean eh the apex of the curve is higher than the two base points basically|check
g|yes|reply_y
f|right|acknowledge
f|and then a the reverse of the concavity of the thing to come round to the alpine garden|check
g|yeah|reply_y
g|you stop on a level with the m-- disused monastery to slightly to the left of the alpine garden|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
f|right|ready
g|then you go up vertically 'til just above the alpine garden|instruct
g|then you mak-- go right to the end of the alpine garden|instruct
g|then vertically again to the top of the youth hostel|instruct
f|there is no youth hostel|explain
g|then about three inches|clarify
f|where was the youth hostel|query_w
g|youth hostel was t-- upwards and to the right of the alpine garden if you go up from four inches from where you stopped at the alpine garden vertically|reply_w
f|right|acknowledge
f|right i think i know where it is|acknowledge
f|right ehm where where would i be going after that|query_w
g|after where|query_w
f|after the this youth hostel|reply_w
g|after youth hostel|query_w
g|you'd be going an inch to your right and then a diagonal line sloping at approximately eh what'd it be now hundred and thirty five degrees from vertical|reply_w
f|right|acknowledge
f|eh can you give me a name of an object i'll be going to|query_w
g|the telephone box|reply_w
f|right okay uh right|acknowledge
f|so i go up just below th-- just to below the parked van|check

g|you go|instruct
f|so it's|check
g|two inches right from that and then a straight line diagonally 'til underneath the telephone box|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
f|all right|acknowledge
f|underneath the telephone telephone box|check
g|yes|reply_y
f|right|acknowledge
g|not directly underneath it|clarify
g|you're going to draw a s-- you're going to have to draw a straight line adding on to that that passes underneath the telephone box|clarify
f|right right okay|acknowledge
f|okay|ready
g|then there's a straight line going under the telephone box|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|and a vertical line going up the right-hand side of the telephone box|instruct
f|and where does it go to|query_w
g|it stops about level with the top of the telephone box|reply_w
g|then there's a sort of exponential curve that goes up to your right from that point and it starts to become vertical to the left of the telephone box on a l-- line left of the telephone box|instruct
f|and where's it going to is it going to the level crossing|query_yn
g|it's going|reply_w

f|through the level crossing|acknowledge
f|ehm aren't we meant to eh avoid obstacles|query_yn
g|avoid them|check

g|it's on a level with the picket fence|clarify
g|have you got that top left corner|query_yn
f|yeah i've got that|reply_y
g|the finish point is on a level with that underneath the most left point of the east lake|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
f|r-- i'll go round it the level crossing|explain
f|okay|align
g|right|reply_y
f|is it a straight line or a curve|query_w
g|it curves|reply_w
g|eh if the telephone box is there it curves up and then goes like that|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
g|from that's from seen from my point of view|clarify
f|and that's from the right-hand side of the telephone box|query_yn
g|from the right-hand side of the telephone box it goes to the left-hand point|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
f|well i can't do an exponential so|explain
g|that's the path marked there|explain
f|i'll see what i can do|explain
f|right|ready
g|that you at the finish point|align
f|i'm just at the eh left-hand bottom corner of the east lake|reply_w
g|the left-hand bot-- corner|acknowledge
g|you go just about an inch to your left|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|and that's the finish point|instruct
