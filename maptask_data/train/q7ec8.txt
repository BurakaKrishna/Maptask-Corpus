g|you know where the c-- er the carpenter's house is|align
f|yes|reply_y
g|well take about a couple of inches well about an inch a couple of inches just just below the start of it do a curve which just about meets the haystack and eh goes to just eh directly below a level with jus-- just below level with the start eh the carpenter's house|instruct
f|so you go if i curve from the start round to|check
g|so you're doing it's like a|clarify
g|it's like|clarify
f|just along and|check
g|a backwards "c"|clarify
f|mm|acknowledge

g|okay|align
f|mm right|reply_y
f|i don't have that|explain
g|so|ready
g|eh what i need to do is i need to go round it again an inverted "c" well it's no an inverted "c" it's li-- the other way about opposite "c"|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|and you need to go around it so eh|instruct
f|so i sort of curve underneath seven beeches and round and then over to back to where i started from|check
g|yeah so you|reply_y
g|the the actual point where you want to finish up is eh|instruct
g|you see the the thick tree trunk on the right-hand side of the seven beeches|align

f|no|reply_n
f|the reclaimed fields are quite a distance away|explain
g|miles below it yeah|check
f|aye|reply_y
g|well eh|ready
g|we'll call it just about two inches maybe a bit more call it two and a half inches below the tree trunk|instruct
g|right|align
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|and that's where you e-- want to finish up|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|so to do that you'll need to take from the "s" and go round like from twelve o'clock to three o'clock|instruct

f|so i'll have to miss that|explain
f|so|ready
f|if i come round in my curve and then i'm going along and then curving back round the same way|check
g|yeah|reply_y
g|so the shape will be you'll be going east and then you'll be going down|clarify
f|a kind of inverted in a "s" a backwards "s"|check
g|it's not|reply_n
g|well prob--|clarify
f|sort of|ready
