f|right|acknowledge
f|okay|acknowledge
g|right|ready
g|from there you just want to go g-- eh curves you're underneath the saloon bar|instruct
f|right|acknowledge

g|well the finish is|explain
g|ehm i was going to say where where the says finish but of course that's not particularly useful|explain
g|ehm a couple of i'd say five centimetres above the saloon bar and just off a few centimetres off the side of the map on the left-hand side that's where the finish is|explain
f|oh right ehm|acknowledge
f|i've come down to the left of the saloon bar and i'm like at the bottom of the saloon bar just now|explain
g|y-- right|ready
g|you're bottom of the saloon bar|check
f|uh-huh|reply_y
g|right|ready
g|you just want to curve up eh along past the saloon bar|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|and|ready
g|it's it's about eh it's just a few centimetres out from the left-hand side of the page a few centimetres up from the saloon bar it's|instruct
f|oh right|acknowledge
f|no i'm going towards the right just now|explain
g|oh you're going towards the right sorry|acknowledge
f|uh-huh|reply_y
g|right|ready
g|you just want you want to be you're at the bottom of the saloon bar|instruct
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
