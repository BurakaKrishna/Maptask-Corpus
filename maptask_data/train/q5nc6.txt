g|go to the end of that|instruct
f|parallel to the the rocket warehouse|check
g|uh-huh|reply_y
f|right okay|acknowledge
g|right|ready
g|slope slope down again to the left directly|instruct
f|to directly to the left so to|check
g|directly to|reply_y
f|to the left|check
g|like you're sloping down like a seven o'clock line|clarify
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|okay|align
f|to the left of the rocket warehouse|check
g|uh-huh|reply_y
f|how far down|query_w
g|you should be about ehm six centimetres above the bottom of the page|reply_w
f|so below the rocket warehouse|check
g|no|reply_n
