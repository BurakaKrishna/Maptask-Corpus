g|well keep to the left-hand side of the avalanche draw the line downwards towards th-- slightly towards the right okay i want you to go really close to the avalanche but don't go past it and then keep that line going vertically downwards until you get just above the top of the concealed hideout|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
f|eh are you trying to az-- avoid an obstacle here|query_yn
g|i'm trying to avoid your avalanche but there's nothing here|reply_w
f|so does it oh how does it how does the line go does it go just like a straight line between just below pine grove to the hi-- concealed hideout or|check
g|if you can draw that straight line without|clarify
f|i can yes|explain
g|without|clarify
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|okay right that's fine|acknowledge
g|without getting in the avalanche that's fine|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
f|s-- and eh i want to be just above|check
g|just above the the peak of the concealed hideout|clarify
f|right right|acknowledge
g|okay that's fine right|acknowledge
g|now i want you to go round ehm to your left of the concealed hideout|instruct
g|is there a boat house|query_yn
f|no|reply_n
f|oh there's a boat house on the eh|explain
g|uh-huh but|acknowledge
f|to the right and down|explain
g|i wa-- ehm i've got one to the left|explain
g|okay|align
f|uh-huh right|reply_y
g|ehm so if you can imagine there's a boat house there so it's kind of like in the middle of the whole map|explain
f|right|acknowledge
f|is it in the wee bulge eh just above crane bay|check
g|it's above that directly above that|clarify
f|right okay|acknowledge
g|okay if you can imagine that's there i want you to go i want you to draw it round concealed hideout come to the to the right of concealed hideout|instruct
g|okay|align
f|right|reply_y
f|eh to the right of concealed hi-- hideout|check
g|mmhmm|reply_y
g|so take that line that have you drawn and|instruct
f|is this is just to the left is this a right on the map or a le-- a right o--|check
f|okay|acknowledge
g|the right of concealed hideout|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
g|and then continue the line underneath concealed hideout so you're drawing to the right and then underneath concealed hideout|instruct
f|and underneath to the left do you mean like going from left to right underneath the concealed l-- hi-- hideout|check
g|from right to left uh-huh|reply_y
f|from right to left right okay|acknowledge
f|so i come round the the concealed hideout|check
g|yeah|reply_y
f|from right to left|check

f|right okay|acknowledge
f|right so curve right|acknowledge
g|okay|ready

g|and i want you to draw from where you are just now in a semicircular shape until you come horizontal with a line|instruct
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|beside the flagship can you do that avoiding whatever you've got underneath the pebbled shore|instruct
f|ehm does this does this curve follow th--|check
g|that's towards the right|instruct
g|towards the left sorry|instruct
f|does the curve follow the coastline or does it f-- go the opposite way|check
