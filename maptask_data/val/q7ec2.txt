f|then then straight down to the two inch mark|check
g|no|reply_n
g|it's southwest er about five ten degrees off south to the southwest to finish under the beech tree the the right-hand beech tree|clarify
f|going southwest|check
g|going southwest|reply_y
f|to finish under the second beech tree i would have to go southeast if i only moved over one inch to the east in the first movement because you said two inches|explain
g|well make it one and a half inch sorry one and a half inch east|clarify
f|what's one and a half|query_w
g|you what you want to do is you want to clear the eh first movement round the chapel will have to clear the beech trees and then come down again to under the first ts on the right-hand beech tree|clarify
f|right|ready
f|i'll try and describe it to you what i think|explain
f|i've come down from to the "s" i'm at the "s" just now|explain
g|right|acknowledge
f|of seven i'll continue down but curving round to my right|explain
g|yeah|acknowledge
f|okay until i've done a quarter curve a quarter of a circle|explain
g|that's right yeah|acknowledge
g|and that should be just on the level of the the very end of the wee leaves on the beech trees|clarify
f|ah in mine that's far more than an inch|explain
