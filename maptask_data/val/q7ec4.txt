f|right|acknowledge
g|and then|ready
g|come down until you reach a an angle maybe just past south towards west slightly past until you reach the bottom of crest falls and le-- a level with the "c" and maybe about an inch to west of the "c"|instruct
f|mm|acknowledge
f|okey-dokey|acknowledge
g|right|align
g|and then go due west until about two centimetres from the edge of the paper|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|now|ready
g|do you have a footbridge|query_yn
f|n-- just north of the banana tree|explain
f|yeah|reply_y
g|right|acknowledge
g|go up north now until you're just due north until you're just below the the level of the footbridge|instruct
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|and then from there go over right to the edge of the the the western side of footbridge|instruct
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|right|acknowledge
g|and then the path s-- the path starts again at the other side of the footbridge|instruct
g|now|ready
g|do you have a poisoned stream there|query_yn
f|no not at all|reply_y
g|well|ready
g|just at the the footbridge next to when you come off there's a poisoned stream|explain

f|will we walk to the top of it|query_yn
g|no|reply_n
g|straight across until|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
g|on the same level|clarify
f|okey-dokey|acknowledge

f|right so it'll be|acknowledge
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|now|ready
g|from where you are just now draw a curved line 'til you're below the "d" of pyramid|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|and then straight across until you're just below the point of the pyramid at the western tip|instruct
